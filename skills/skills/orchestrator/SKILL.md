# RHDP Publishing House

**RULE: If any `publishing-house/tools/` script exits with a non-zero exit code, STOP immediately.** Show the error output to the author and say there was an issue calling the backend. Do not continue the skill.

You handle everything. The author just talks to you. Never tell the author to run scripts or terminal commands.

## What to do when invoked

**Step 1 — Verify this is a Publishing House project:**

Run silently:
```bash
python3 -c "
from pathlib import Path
ci = Path('catalog-info.yaml')
spec = Path('publishing-house/spec.yaml')
if ci.exists() and spec.exists():
    print('ok')
elif not ci.exists():
    print('no-catalog')
else:
    print('no-spec')
"
```

- `ok` → proceed to Step 2.
- `no-catalog` → this is not a Publishing House project. Show:
  > This doesn't look like a Publishing House project — `catalog-info.yaml` is missing.
  >
  > Projects must be created through the **RHDH Developer Hub** template. Open RHDH, choose the **Publishing House Content Project** template, and fill in the form. That will create the repo, register it in the catalog, and start the workflow.
  >
  > Then open the created repo in DevSpaces and run `/rhdp-publishing-house` again.

  **STOP — do not proceed.**
- `no-spec` → show: "`publishing-house/spec.yaml` is missing. This repo may not have been scaffolded correctly." **STOP.**

**Step 2 — Read project identity:**

Run silently:
```bash
python3 -c "
import yaml
from pathlib import Path
spec = yaml.safe_load(Path('publishing-house/spec.yaml').read_text()) or {}
pid = spec.get('project', {}).get('slug', '')
print(f'project_id:{pid}')
"
```

Extract `project_id` from the output. This is used for all subsequent API calls.

If `project_id` is empty → show error: "`project.slug` is missing in `spec.yaml`." **STOP.**

**Step 3 — Check auth:**

Run silently:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json, os
f = os.path.expanduser('~/.config/publishing-house/auth.json')
if os.path.exists(f):
    d = json.load(open(f))
    cred = d.get('credential', '')
    central = d.get('central', '')
    print(f'cred:{cred[:8]}' if cred else 'no-cred')
    print(f'central:{central}')
else:
    print('missing')
"
```

Extract `central_url` from the `central:` line. This is used for all subsequent API calls.

- Output has `cred:` and `central:` → auth is configured. Proceed to Step 5 silently.
- Output is `missing` → show error: "Workspace auth is not configured. Restart the DevSpaces workspace to trigger setup." **STOP.**
- Output is `no-cred` → the author needs a portal key.

  **ALWAYS show this message:**

  > **You need a Publishing House API key.**
  >
  > Open this URL in your browser:
  > **`{central_url}`**
  >
  > Log in with your Red Hat SSO, click **Generate New Key**, and **paste the key here** — I'll save it for you.

  Then try to open the browser (works locally, silently fails in DevSpaces):
  ```bash
  python3 -c "import subprocess; subprocess.Popen(['open', 'CENTRAL_URL'])" 2>/dev/null || true
  ```
  Replace CENTRAL_URL with the actual `central_url`.

  Wait for the author to paste the key in the chat. Once received, save it:
  ```bash
  python3 -c "
import json, os
key = 'PASTE_KEY_HERE'
path = os.path.expanduser('~/.config/publishing-house/auth.json')
d = json.load(open(path)) if os.path.exists(path) else {}
d['credential'] = key
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(path), exist_ok=True)
with open(path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(d, f, indent=2)
os.chmod(path, 0o600)
print('saved')
"
  ```
  Replace PASTE_KEY_HERE with the actual key.

  Confirm: > Got it — you're all set.

**Step 4 — Read spec.yaml and check workflow state:**

Read `publishing-house/spec.yaml` using the Read tool. Note:
- `project.deployment_mode` — `rhdp_published` or `self_published`
- `project.jira_ticket` — may be blank
- All other pre-populated fields — the intake sub-skill will skip asking about those

Then run the shared workflow script silently:
```bash
python publishing-house/tools/ph-workflow.py
```

Extract `stage`, `epic_key`, and `workflow_id` from the output. The stage will be one of: `intake`, `review`, `development`, `ready`, or `published`.

The script handles everything: resolves `workflow_id` (calling `/workflow-data` if missing), syncs `jira_ticket` to spec.yaml for `rhdp_published` projects, and queries `/workflow-state` for the current stage. If spec.yaml was updated, commit silently:
```bash
git add publishing-house/spec.yaml
git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "feat: sync workflow data from Central API" 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Step 5 — Stage loop:**

This is a loop. After dispatching a skill and it returns, query the API again for the new stage and continue.

```
Loop:
  If stage is intake → dispatch rhdp-publishing-house:intake, wait for return
                        → query API again (same as Step 4), extract new stage, continue loop
  If stage is development → show development status (see below), stop
  If stage is review → show review status (see below), stop
  If stage is ready → show ready status (see below), stop
  If stage is published → show published status (see below), stop
```

To query the API again after a skill returns, run the same script from Step 5 and extract the new `stage`.

## Intake stage — dispatch rhdp-publishing-house:intake

When stage is `intake`, dispatch the intake sub-skill immediately:

```
Dispatch: rhdp-publishing-house:intake
```

The intake skill handles the full flow: interview → spec writing → author approval →
mkdocs generation → commit → API submission → result display. When it returns, the
orchestrator queries the API again for the new stage and continues the loop.

## Stage responses (non-intake)

**review** (content_review or infra_review)
> Spec submitted. Two reviews are in progress:
> - **Content Review** — design spec and module outlines
> - **Infra Review** — environment and automation requirements
>
> Both must complete before advancing to Development. Reviewers approve from the RHDH Publishing House portal.

**development**
> You're building. [show failures if any, otherwise: "All checks look good."]
> What do you need help with?

**ready**
> Final gate. Reviewer needs to sign off.
> [show failures if any]

**published**
> This lab is published. ✅

## Rules

- Never tell the author to run any script except opening the portal URL during first-time key setup
- ALWAYS show the portal URL in the conversation — never rely solely on `open` working (DevSpaces has no browser)
- **`project_id`** comes from `spec.yaml` `project.slug` — this is the canonical identifier
- **`central_url`** comes from `~/.config/publishing-house/auth.json` `central` field — written by DevSpaces setup
- Stage is always read from the Central API — auth.json does not store stage
- No `.ph-state` file — all state comes from catalog-info.yaml, spec.yaml, and the Central API
- The orchestrator dispatches skills but does not own submission or advancement — each skill calls its own API endpoint
